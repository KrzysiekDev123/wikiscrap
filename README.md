# wikiscrap
Simple program going through Wikipedia articles as a graph with Breadth-First-Search.

Currently it has 2 modes:<br>

**find**: Starts from the given article and finds the path to another one <br>
**normal**:  Starts from the given article and finds all articles you can reach from it. Probably scans the whole Wikipedia and stops after human extinction.


### TO DO
1. Searching from the local copy of Wikipedia to stop spamming with requests and increase performance
